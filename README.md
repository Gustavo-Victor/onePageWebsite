## 💻 About
This project is a complete one-page website made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The purpose of this project is to train development skills in these languages. This site was based on a Bootstrap template available [at this link](https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/OnePage/) and also on some [Danki Code](https://www.youtube.com/c/DankiCode) YouTube channel lives. I would like to thank Danki Code a lot, because thanks to them I could learn a lot.
